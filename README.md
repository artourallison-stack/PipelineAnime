# Pipeline v0 — Hugging Face Space

This is a minimal, stable pipeline skeleton.

## What works
- Orchestrated pipeline
- Unified logging
- Arbiter + Police Engineer stubs
- Runtime config (online-editable)
- Gradio UI control panel

## What is stubbed
- Visual generation (placeholder image)
- Arbiter logic
- Police Engineer logic

## Next steps
- Replace VisualGeneratorStub with SDXL via HF Inference API
- Expand Arbiter and Police Engineer
- Add online-patch endpoints
